# Concept of Quickshot Blitz (temporary name)

The player navigates in small rooms, equipped with a gun and the ability to dash. They have to get to the goal of each room to proceed to the next one. If the player is damaged by anything, they start the room over. The dash shrink their hitbox but they can still take damage.

Each room is quite difficult to traverse, and may require many attempts to reach the goal.
