# Game Design Document

Game design document for Quickshot Blitz (temporary name).

## Rules

### Movement

Movement is simple arrow keys movement. The dash has a short cooldown to prevent constantly dashing. The dash travels a fixed distance upon execution, this balances the speed boost and low vulnerability with a commitment.

### Shooting

The player can shoot a slow firing, bullet with their gun. There is no "damage" or "HP" it either kills it or does no damage. However, it can stun or knockback instead in some cases, this makes hitting targets which is already difficult more rewarding. Aiming is also done with the arrow keys, so it aims where the player is going, which encourages aggressivity instead of fleeing while shooting. It is not possible to shoot when dashing, but if the player tries to do so, it will fire when the dash is over to prevent misinput.

### Goal

When the player gets to the goal, they immidiately proceed to the next room. The goal itself does not have any condition to be reached, but there can be doors that are locked by certain conditions, preventing the player from immediately reaching the goal. This allows for goals that are more complex than just go from point A to point B, which would mean the player can ignore every enemy in every level for example.
